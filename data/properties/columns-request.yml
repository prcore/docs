        The definition can be used to define the type of the column, and it can be chosen from the following list:

        1. Special types of definition:
            - `CASE_ID`
        2. Basic types of definitions:
            - `TEXT`
            - `NUMBER`
            - `BOOLEAN`
            - `DATETIME`
        3. Common types of definitions:
            - `ACTIVITY` (sepcial definition of `TEXT`)
            - `TIMESTAMP` (sepcial definition of `DATETIME`)
            - `RESOURCE` (sepcial definition of `TEXT`)
        4. Optional types of definitions:
            - `DURATION` (sepcial definition of `NUMBER`)
            - `COST` (sepcial definition of `NUMBER`)
            - `START_TIMESTAMP` (sepcial definition of `DATETIME`)
            - `END_TIMESTAMP` (sepcial definition of `DATETIME`)

        Only one definition can be chosen for one column. If the definition is not chosen, the default definition is `TEXT`.

        These definitions are required for columns of the dataset:

        1. `CASE_ID`
        2. `TIMESTAMP` (OR `START_TIMESTAMP` and `END_TIMESTAMP`)
        3. `ACTIVITY`

        If one of the `START_TIMESTAMP` and `END_TIMESTAMP` is defined, the other one must be defined as well.

        Here we don't differentiate the `Case attribute` and `Event attribute`, because the PrCore doesn't need this information when processing the [outcome and treatment definition](#outcome-and-treatment-definition).
