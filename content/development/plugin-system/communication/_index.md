In this section, we will delve into the communication process between the core and the plugins. PrCore acts as the intermediary, handling all communication between the two, so there is no need for concern on your end if you're trying to add a new plugin. Nevertheless, understanding the underlying mechanism is beneficial.

It's worth noting that the communication occurs through the RabbitMQ message broker exclusively.
