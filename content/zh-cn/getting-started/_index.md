## Introduction

PrCore is a backend software that offers APIs to implement certain features of prescriptive process monitoring. It allows users to upload event logs and provides definitions, which can then be used to train models based on historical data. When users submit new logs, PrCore is capable of providing different types of prescriptions for ongoing cases.

Users can obtain results for all cases in the logs by uploading new log files. In addition, sending stream data of new events through APIs allows users to receive timely prescribing recommendations from PrCore.

PrCore uses a modular design that makes adding new machine learning algorithms to the program an easy task. This allows researchers to effortlessly add new plugins according to the documentation, providing other categories of prescriptions for testing algorithms of interest.

Overall, PrCore is a sophisticated tool that enables prescriptive process monitoring and offers users an efficient and customizable way to analyze event logs and improve their processes.

规定性流程监控（prescriptive process monitoring）是一种监控方法，它通过实时跟踪和分析业务流程，预测可能的失败案例，并提供相应的建议以实现预期结果。Prescriptive（规定性）意味着这种方法会为流程操作者提供类似处方的建议，如果他们采纳了这些建议，案例成功的概率将会较大。案例的成功与否通常是根据关键绩效指标（KPI）来计算的，这些指标由企业和领域专家定义。因此，规定性流程监控的目标是帮助企业在流程执行过程中作出更明智的决策，从而提高效率和生产力。
