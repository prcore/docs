Based on which way you use to send new  data, you will get results in different ways.

If you sent new data by uploading a file, you can get the results by calling the [Get Dataset Result](/workflow/get-prescriptions/get-dataset-result/) endpoint.

If you sent new data by streaming, you can get the results by subscribing to the [Get Streaming Result ](/workflow/get-prescriptions/get-streaming-result/) endpoint.
