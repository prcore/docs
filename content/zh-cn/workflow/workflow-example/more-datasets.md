The program is also tested with the following datasets:

- [BPI Challenge 2017](/download/bpic2017-XES.zip): [workflow-example-bpic2017.py](/download/workflow-example-bpic2017.py)
  - The example script contains both outcome and treatment definition.
- [BPI Challenge 2011](/download/bpic2011-XES.zip): [workflow-example-bpic2011.py](/download/workflow-example-bpic2011.py)
  - The example script only contains outcome definition, for testing the `causallift` plugin's automatic disabling. 

The example scripts use simulation to send new events to the server.
