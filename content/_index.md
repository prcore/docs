PrCore is a backend application for prescriptive process monitoring. It takes historical event log files and provides prescriptions for ongoing cases based on the received event streaming data. It is flexible in that it can be applied to various domains' event logs. Additionally, its prescribing and predicting algorithms can be easily modified, replaced, or added, thanks to its plugin mechanism.
