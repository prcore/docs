## Introduction

PrCore is a backend software that offers APIs to implement certain features of prescriptive process monitoring. It allows users to upload event logs and provides definitions, which can then be used to train models based on historical data. When users submit new logs, PrCore is capable of providing different types of prescriptions for ongoing cases.

Users can obtain results for all cases in the logs by uploading new log files. In addition, sending stream data of new events through APIs allows users to receive timely prescribing recommendations from PrCore.

PrCore uses a modular design that makes adding new machine learning algorithms to the program an easy task. This allows researchers to effortlessly add new plugins according to the documentation, providing other categories of prescriptions for testing algorithms of interest.

Overall, PrCore is a sophisticated tool that enables prescriptive process monitoring and offers users an efficient and customizable way to analyze event logs and improve their processes.
