Based on which way you use to send new  data, you will get results in different ways.

If you sent new data by uploading a file, you can get the results by calling the [Get Dataset Result]({{< relref "./get-dataset-result.md" >}}) endpoint.

If you sent new data by streaming, you can get the results by subscribing to the [Get Streaming Result]({{< relref "./get-streaming-result/_index.md">}}) endpoint.
