## Added

- Added the `negative_outcome` field in the `POST /project` API, which allows you to define the negative outcome instead of positive outcome. Please note that they are mutually exclusive, you can only specify one of them. For more details, please refer to [Project Creation]({{< relref "../workflow/upload-event-log/project-creation.md" >}}).
