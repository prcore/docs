## Added

The following new features are added in this release:

- Return the resources count of the training dataset in the response of the `PUT /event_log/{event_log_id}` API.


## Updated

- Improved the way to infer the column definitions.
- The simulation events number is now limited to 1800, which is about 30 minutes of simulation, if the sending rate is 1 event per second.
- Allow two decimal places in duration definition.

## Fixed

- Fixed a bug that the preprocessed dataset has traces with length less than 3.
- Fixed a bug that can't handle the gzip compressed event log (gzip type is used in macOS when compressing single file).
- Fixed a bug that can't preprocess very small event logs.
