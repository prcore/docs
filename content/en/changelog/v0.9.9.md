## Added

The following new features are added in this release:

- Now the processed training dataset will also include a new column `TREATMENT_RESOURCE`, which is the resource where the treatment is triggered the first time in the case, according to the definition of the treatment provided by the user. If you're interested in developing a plugin that uses this new column, please refer to [Algorithm]({{< relref "../development/plugin-system/add-new-plugin/algorithm.md" >}}) for more details.
- Now the enabled plugins environment variable `ENABLED_PLUGINS` should be added to the `.env` file in the root directory of PrCore.

## Fixed

The following bugs are fixed in this release:

- Fixed a bug when treatment definition is not provided, the preprocessing will fail.
- Fixed a bug of the AND condition identification of the outcome and treatment definition.
