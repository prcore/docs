## Breaking Changes

The following changes are breaking changes. Please make sure to update your code accordingly, otherwise, you may encounter errors.

- The request body in [Columns definition](/workflow/upload-event-log/columns-definition/) has been changed. The `columns_definition` field is required, you can easily move the entire old body to this field.


## Added

## Updated

- If the connection of "reading simulation stream result" is closed, the server won't stop the simulation immediately. Instead, it will wait for one more minute to see if the connection is re-established. If the connection is still closed, the simulation will be stopped.
- Updated the documentation to reflect the changes.

## Fixed

- Fixed a bug when `DURATION` is set in the outcome definition, but the endpoint return a `internal server error` response.
- Fixed a database race condition issue when the simulation is running.
